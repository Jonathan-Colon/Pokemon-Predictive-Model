# POKEMON PREDICTIVE MODELING Project
### Using API, Kaggle datasets, and creating a similar battle model to pokemon, I attempted to create a predictive model via creation of composite scoring of 6-pokemon teams (synergy Scores)

# Program used
## python via spider and google collab


## How was the data cleaned or transformed? 
### I pulled all data from pokeapi and coded equations that dictate similar patterns and damage to that of the pokemon franchise

## Currently, the best way I have found to create a predictive model for a team was create a synergy score that would be a quanitative expression encompassing things such as pokemon type and move type for coverage and bonus damage, as well as abilities and individualized stat distribution 

Example equation:
# Final damage calculation
## final_damage = base_damage * stab_multiplier * effectiveness * crit_multiplier * item_boost * random_factor

What are the regulations to using the data?
This data is strictly for experimentation purposes and I do not receive, nor look to receive compensation from this data owned by any and all entities surround the Pokemon franchise.
